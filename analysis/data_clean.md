Liked that the screen is easier to read. Nice printed menus too. Purchased a Groupon  (4 burgers 4 sides) gave our orders (one burger and side to go) and was charged $26 and change. 
[...]
Guess what came to our table. Yep, 2 burgers and 2 fries (you know, the one pair that was to go). Explained to the server that we ordered 4, again no apologies, checks with the lady 1 at the register and shortly brings our order to us. Fries tasted like fries anywhere else, crispy, plain. Nothing special like before. Burgers were bland, both my husband and son said burgers were 'ok, not really tasty like last time.'
As we're eating, I notice lady 2 walking and chatting to other patrons. She stop by our table to make amends? Why of course not. She looked at us though, and walked away.
Last week I told my sisters to eat here. Just sent a message on group chat telling them not to waste their time. Few weeks ago told my coworkers to stop by here when they're in the neighborhood, I'll tell them about this visit on Monday.

i cannot even begin to thank debbie enough she is a life saver ! ! i had picked up 2 bridesmaids dresses from a different shop , when i tried them on they were both a disaster neither had cups , which i asked for , and one of the dresses hems was totally butchered one of the two weddings was saturday , and i had picked up the dress tuesday a few of my friends recommended debbie to me so i hurried and called her in a panic ! she asked if i could come in wednesday morning and i was so happy she made the time for me on such short notice ! she sewed the cups into my one dress on the spot so i could leave with the dress the other dress she completed in no time with a wonderful hem and fitting the top she made them both look so beautiful and fit me perfectly on top of perfecting both dresses , debbie was so sweet ! i had so much fun going to her house and chatting away she always got back to me and really helped me when i was feeling defeated about my dress for the wedding and her prices are amazing ! my jaw dropped when she gave me the final total for each dress my only regret is that it took me this long to find debbie ! she is truly a rockstar ! \. 

i got married this past weekend and i would never have felt as good as i did if it were n't for debbie i got my dress from glitter and grit and when i received it , it was pretty but not everything i had hoped for originally i ordered it with sleeves but they came unlined and it was also much more low cut than i had imagined it needed some serious help to fit me like it should glitter and grit recommended debbie and i called her immediately she asked me to send over some pictures and i texted them to her and she responded right away saying she could definitely help make this dress what i dreamed it would be she does all of her work from her home , which is set up perfectly upon walking in her front door you immediately are in a room with tall , giant mirrors and large lights and comfortable couches to make the experience of getting fitted for your dress enjoyable after meeting her and talking with her for just a few minutes , i knew right then that she was serious and super experienced she was so confident that she could do all the things i wanted for my dress and i trusted her from the start she ordered the exact same fabric that the rest of my dress was lined with so she could also line my sleeves to match she also altered my dress to have the shoulders fit my petite height and to make the neckline a bit higher like i had imagined every time i went for another fitting , i would bring either jewelry , purses , or shoes to try on with my dress to see if they would match and debbie always gave me the time to do so and offered her opinions when i needed and asked for them when i came in for my last fitting pick up the week before my wedding , i walked in the front door and my dress was hanging displayed on the giant mirrors and it looked prettier than ever for all the many things she did to alter the dress , no one would have ever been able to tell because the quality of her work was so flawless lastly , my dress had a beautiful train that really could not be bustled i was so torn whether to try to keep it on for the whole night or to cut it off all together since my dress was made of tulle , it did not need to be hemmed or measured to be cut from the bottom it occurred to me that maybe i could wear my dress with my pretty train to the ceremony and then cut it off for the reception i presented this idea to debbie , and she said she had never gone to a wedding to do that before but she would think about it at my next fitting she said she would come to my wedding venue and we agreed on a price for this service she showed up on sunday after my ceremony and was waiting in my suite and promptly chopped off my train it felt like a whole new dress when i went into my reception what a life saver ! i got the best of both worlds out of my beautiful dress i would highly recommend debbie she is an excellent seamstress , very knowledgeable , and easy to work with even when wedding stress is so high ! \. 

i never leave reviews but i feel this is absolutely necessary if i could leave no stars i would words ca n't describe how i'm feeling right now i am devastated debbie gave us the worst customer service and butchered my dress it 's been a nightmare we leave for my wedding in less than 48 hrs and we just got my dress today ! ! ! ! ! ! i do n't have a dress for my wedding ! ! ! ! it 's ruined ! i went to debbie because glitter and grit in lawrenceville , recommended me to her so we trusted their referral i reached out to debbie in april , \( wedding september \) and told her what i needed , which was very simple , just replace bra cups , take in the skirt , along with add some light boning structure to the top she promised me she could do all of this without the top looking or feeling different and it would be an easy fix i also said i wanted to try to lose weight \( i do n't have a thyroid \) and so i asked when i should bring the dress in she sent me an email saying to bring it august 7th , a month before our wedding , and she would have plenty of time to do the work so i did just that plan was set in stone for the work and i felt confident i went back as planned august 25th , for my scheduled pick up , first off she changed the appt time , and then made me wait 30 mins , i could literally hear her sewing in her basement she told me she just needed to iron it , which was a lie she brought it out and it was not done i was mortified ! the top used to hug me , mold to my shape and was light and airy , she added a liner and made it bulky and the shape was all wrong , very unflattering and not what it looked like prior you could also see the plastic boning through the material my heart sank she promised she would have the dress done by the following thursday , and she was very rude to me like this was my fault , talked about how busy she was , did n't listen to my concerns , made excuses and sent me on my way last thursday rolled around \( the 31st \) and she sent me a text cancelling my appt the morning of ! saying how it was n't done yet she then ignored all of my texts so i had my fianc call her she was so rude to him was literally screaming at him over the phone ! ! ! ! ! ! and would n't stop arguing with him ! we caught her in so many lies and she did not follow through with what she said she would do , canceling and rescheduling and then blaming me ! ! ! ! she is literally crazy ! and not making sense ! she also said that the picture of the dress from the designer is photo shopped well i have pics of me in the dress when i first bought it and they are n't photo shopped horrible customer service blaming me and not making any sense and she literally said you do n't appreciate perfection bottom line is my dress was not ready when she said it would be and she butchered it on top of that her house has a very musty odor and my dress smells i just can not believe this is happening days before our wedding she also showed my fianc my dress when he asked her not to she this out of spite i now need a new dress and i am out a lot of money because of this woman do not go to her ! ! ! update 9 9 17 i have 2 written and 3 verbal statements from employees seamstresses from bhldn , and an email from the designer , catherine deane , stating that the dress is ruined and it 's non reversible they were in shock when they seen what it looked like \( i took it to them in person while i shopped for a new dress all the way to philadelphia because they do n't have a bhldn in pittsburgh \) not only does the dress look completely different , it 's crooked , sloppy and just a mess their recommendation was to have debbie pay for the dress \( yeah right \) and give it to someone for a halloween costume my wedding gown thanks , debbie \. 

tl dr i cannot recommend that you take your wedding dress to debbie she frequently cancelled appointments , was unresponsive to communications , and did not finish my dress in time for my wedding the full story i took my convertible dress \( a sheath and a separate tulle overskirt \) to debbie in early february , along with several printed pictures demonstrating the changes i wanted to make , which we discussed at length she said she would finish some of the lace detail work in a couple of weeks , and we scheduled a second fitting for two weeks later the night before the scheduled fitting she texted me to cancel and reschedule my second fitting ended up happening towards the end of march , at which point she had not done the detail work she said would be done weeks prior , and the dress was in pieces in the first week of april my now husband and i decided to move up our wedding from september to june i reached out to debbie to let her know of the change and ask if the dress could be finished in time she never responded , but i was n't too worried because i already had a third fitting scheduled for the first week in may the night before that fitting she texted me to cancel , suggesting the following saturday i agreed to saturday and asked what time , but she did not respond for the next six days i could not get a hold of her to confirm a time , until i finally called her from my work phone \( a number she would n't recognize \) when she answered and i told her who i was she did not sound happy that i had got a hold of her , but she did commit to a time for saturday at that third fitting she complained several times that she was having to work that saturday \( since she normally only works every other saturday \) , even though she was the one who cancelled on me and suggested it as an alternative although i had provided her with many pictures of changes to the dress , she had forgotten about two of the major details \( adding sleeves and fitting the skirt \) until i asked when they would be done before we finished the fitting she asked me to take home the overskirt and work on it myself , adding that she would just charge me a lot of money if she were to do it so even though i can barely sew i took home my overskirt while she kept the dress to continue working on it we scheduled a fourth fitting for the first saturday in june \( and since she had n't even pinned the hem yet , a fifth would have been necessary \) that morning two weeks before my wedding she texted me to cancel the fitting and reschedule , suggesting the following saturday or sometime during the week i agreed to come in during the week , but did not get an immediate response from her from my experience the last time she had cancelled on me , i suspected that i would not be able to get a hold of her to reschedule the fitting in time , so i realized i needed a backup dress although i had the overskirt in my possession , it had never been hemmed or fitted at the waist , and i still needed a dress to wear under it so with less than two weeks before my wedding i started looking for another dress , and fortunately i found one , because i did n't hear from debbie again until the day before my wedding i do n't know if she just has a terrible system of communicating with her clients , or if she could n't finish my dress and did n't want to say admit it but if she did n't think she could finish the dress in time for the new wedding date , she should have told me in april when i first contacted her about the date change , or in may when she cancelled my third fitting , or even that first week of june when she cancelled my fourth fitting i might have had time to find someone else to finish my alterations , and then wear the dress i 'd spent a year picturing myself wearing on my wedding day instead i spent the last few days before my wedding frantically searching for an off the rack replacement dress , which is the last thing any bride should have to do right before her wedding \. 

i had a terrible experience with debbie while i cannot deny that she is an excellent seamstress , she was extremely unprofessional and made my wedding experience very stressful we both decided that the gown i wanted to wear for my reception was very low quality and she was interested in making a new one for me she assured me that we would have plenty of time for the custom gown as it was a simple 1950s pattern as the weeks went by she began canceling and rescheduling appointments this occurred several times finally at the week before my wedding it was very clear that my dress would not be ready on time to be picked up as scheduled i told her that i was very disappointed that we were in this situation and she became angry with me and accused me of not appreciating her or giving enough time i contacted her three months before my wedding and if it was not enough time to produce a custom dress she should not have accepted the job there were also other signs of unprofessionalism when i pointed out that the darts on my dress were not the same length , she disagreed with me and would not admit that they were uneven until i asked her to measure them when the dress was n't laying right on my bust she said that it was because my bust was uneven and not because of the darts when i asked her to add a ribbon to the dress , she agreed but did not mention anything about the price two days before my wedding she texted me to let me know that there would be an extra 150 charge for the added ribbon at this point , two days before my wedding , she still had not finished my dress and it was missing the zipper , sleeves , and collar at this point , i basically had no choice but to pay when we picked up the dress , she had not pressed it and simply threw the crinoline in the bottom of the garment bag instead of hanging it up my friends had to buy a steamer and steam it for me the day of the wedding her behavior was appalling and i would not recommend her
